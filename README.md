## Self Reflection

This has been a fun assignment to work on for me personally, albeit one of the most taxing mentally. Though having said that, after this assignment I feel I understand a hell of a lot more about Javascript, and to a lesser degree CSS. This is mostly due to it being a more focused and it calling on a lot of our previous lessons.
<br>
On Friday when I started I felt like this was going to be a mountain to climb. I had all my images in place, my HTML set up and my JS was coded to append child elements and produce a full-screen image, but nothing was being displayed on my page other than the buttons I had set up. It's not until I took a step back, went over learning resources and the example website, started afresh in a clean workspace that it started working as it should.
<br>
I also enrolled in freeCodeCamp which has helped me a lot with understanding JS more, and has introduced me to more operators that we have not covered yet. My learning difficulties are making the process of learning three different coding languages at the same time tough, but I have realised that I just need to pick through every bit of information slowly and do more practical exercises in order to deepen my understanding.
<br>
On Saturday I spent more time styling and trying to make it more responsive, and to impliment more of what I saw on the example site. I knew about webkits in CSS, but didn't know that there were more settings I could apply, such as disabling the scrollbar on the y-axis. The example website also showed me transform and transition, which really helped make my buttons position better. I have tried to not peek at the CSS and JS too much on the example website as I think it will throw me now, and also lead me to over-complicate things, but I really need to add more Aria elements to my image gallery.
<br>
I'm going to see if there are some good resources on Aria tonight, and hopefully be able to do this without looking at the example site any more. I feel like peeking in the console is cheating, though I understand we have been shown how to do so in order to learn from others, I just know that it will sway my way of implementing certain effects and features.
<br>
I don't have much more time to work on this as I still need to update my CV,  so I'm going to push what I have so far and, if I get the time, try to add more once the CV is done.
